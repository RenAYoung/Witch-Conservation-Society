# Witch Conservation Society

My favorite project so far! 

Play as a young witch who has been sent on your first mission. You arrive in a field after hearing about something scary happening in a nearby village. Find the ingredients to make potions that will help you access new surrounding areas, and eventually unlock the mysterious caverns.
